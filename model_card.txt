Model Details
Juan Sebastian Jaramillo created the model. It is logistic regression using the followings hypeparameters: max_iter=100, solver='lbfgs', fit_intercept=True, intercept_scaling=1 with the objective to obtain better results, the versión of the libreary is scikit-learn 1.0.2.

Intended Use
This model should be used to predict the income if greather 50K per year base don Census data.  

Metrics
The model was evaluated using Accuracy 0.92 Recall 0.21 and FBeta with 0.34

Data
The data was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income) . 
Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. 

Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes a salary over 50K a year.
The original data set has 32561 rows, 15 columns, cleaned dataset contains 30162 rows, 15 columns. 10 cross validation split was used to break this into a train and test set. No stratification was done. To use the data for training a One Hot Encoder was used on the features.

Bias
This model represents in majority part of categorical sex Mens, who lives in the United States, and race White, the data is unbalanced, specially for objective variable salary for this reason it’s necesary to balance the data because in original form the model is not 100% reliable
